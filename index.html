&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a computer scientist and mathematical scientist who was 

born in
 Rotterdams, Netherlands in 11 May 1930.[1] He studied theoretical physics at Leiden 

University, but he quickly realized he was more interested in computer science. In 1955, he 

decided to work on computer science and he became one of the most famous scientist in the 

world. In 1965 he developed an algorithm that solving method on deciding point. This method 

can solve shortest way between two point in a depended graphic and it called “Dijkstra’s 

Algorithm”.[2]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a pioneer to routing algorithms which is 

using in a lot of computing area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was working in Eindhoven Technical University, he 

developed “THE” operating system. While he was searching on this system, he invented a 

semaphores. Semaphores are like a virtual communication.[3]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put forward critical section concept, classical question of 

philosophs’ dinner problem. At the same time he created like “for, while, if,..” commands 

inspire from “goto” commands.[4] In 1972, Turing Award[5] and in 1974, Harry H. Goode 

Memorial Award[6] were given.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to as popular as Van Gogh all of his life.He likes blues 

music, especially he was a fan of  B.B. King.[7] <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died because of the cancer in Neunen, Netherland in 06 August 

2002.<br>
Next year, the ACM (Association for 
Computing Machinery) PODC Influential Paper Award 
in distributed computing was renamed the Dijkstra Prize in his honour.[8]
